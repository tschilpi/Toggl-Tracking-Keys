some notes for bugfixes and co.

strange behavior for keys:
 cmd / alt keys records both vks for some reason
 -> error when they are recorded
 shift + numpad keys in that order does not record numpad keys for some reason
 -> numpad key is not recorded then, only shift

 numpad keys have duality in vks, sometimes their vk is the numpad key, other times its insert/home etc.


bugs:
